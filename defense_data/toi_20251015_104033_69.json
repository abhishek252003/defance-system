  "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has stirred controversy with her remarks following the alleged gang rape of a 23-year-old MBBS student in Durgapur. Questioning how the student left her private college campus late at night, Banerjee said private institutions must take responsibility for students and the “night culture.” She described the incident as “shocking” and added that Bengal police were taking necessary action. Her comments sparked outrage, with the BJP accusing her of victim shaming. BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari slammed Banerjee, saying she implied women should not go out at night and must ensure their own safety. Banerjee also brought up rape cases in Odisha, questioning that state’s actions. She added that all culprits in the Durgapur case would be punished and demanded strong action in similar cases in other states.\n\nDespite the government shutdown, the Trump administration plans to pay active-duty troops on October 15 using unobligated Pentagon funds, bypassing Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised Trump’s leadership but declined to bring the House back to pass a funding bill. The Pentagon identified $8 billion from prior fiscal year research and development funds to cover pay checks if the shutdown continues. This move echoes the 2013 Pay Our Military Act but is being done without new legislation. Tensions rise as lawmakers remain deadlocked on ending the shutdown.",
