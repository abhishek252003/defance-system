Lather, posted with the cyber cell, made a final video calling Bijarnia an honest officer. The incident comes just days after ADGP Y Puran Kumar reportedly died by suicide at his Chandigarh residence, leaving a note naming 16 senior IAS and IPS officers, alleging harassment. Following these events, the Haryana government placed the state’s DGP on leave and replaced Rohtak SP Bijarnia with Surinder Singh Bhoria. Police cordoned off the area, recovered the weapon, and initiated a forensic investigation into Lather’s death.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ended the war in Ukraine, saying it “makes him look very bad” and could be resolved quickly. Speaking alongside Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump urged Putin to settle the conflict and warned of Russia’s economic struggles, including long lines for gasoline. Trump also confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Washington on Friday and discussed the potential delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, highlighting the balance between defending Ukraine’s territory and the risk of escalation with Russia.
