  "content": "IAS officer Amneet P Kumar seeks FIR against Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia, alleging persecution led to her husband IPS officer Y Puran Kumar’s suicide on October 7. She demands FIR under abetment to suicide and SC/ST Atrocities Act. Amneet claims her husband faced caste-based harassment and humiliation from senior officers, and that a conspiracy was hatched to falsely implicate him in a frivolous extortion case. A false FIR was registered on October 6 targeting her husband’s former staff member. She says her husband’s calls to DGP Kapur and SP Bijarnia went unanswered before his death. Amneet fears evidence tampering by the officers. SP Bijarnia tells TOI Rohtak police did not name Kumar as accused, and the FIR is based on strong evidence. He says Chandigarh police are probing Amneet’s complaint and will ensure a fair investigation.\n\nRussia accused the West of waging 'proxy war' by propagating the myth that Moscow poses a threat to European NATO member states. Speaking at the UNSC, director of Russian Nonproliferation and Arms Control Department, Oleg Postnikov, said Russia has announced it will voluntarily adhere to the New START nuclear warhead limits for one year beyond the treaty’s 2026 expiration — but only if the United States reciprocates. Responding to Moscow’s remarks, U.S. arms control official Paul Watzlavick accused Russia and its allies of destabilizing the global order, citing rising nuclear threats from China, Iran, and North Korea.",
