  "content": "Israel and Hamas are set to sign the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, shortly. A ceasefire is expected to come into effect across Gaza once the deal is signed. Israel’s security cabinet will meet later in the day to approve the agreement. Despite the historic breakthrough, Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, of the Religious Zionism party, announced that his party will not vote in support of the deal, citing concerns over releasing prisoners. Meanwhile, Hamas has reportedly begun moving hostages to secure locations in preparation for their handover, with approximately 20 living hostages expected to be freed simultaneously. The developments come amid high tensions, celebrations in Gaza and Tel Aviv, and anticipation over the potential return of hostages. Watch for more details.\n\nPakistan has accused India of using Afghan territory to carry out proxy terror attacks, in reaction to a recent warning from Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to Islamabad. The statement reportedly triggered a swift response from Pakistan Army spokesperson Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who held an urgent press conference alleging that Afghan soil is being exploited by India to destabilize Pakistan, citing terror statistics as evidence. These remarks follow Taliban claims of Pakistani air strikes in Afghanistan. Analysts suggest that Islamabad is attempting to deflect responsibility after being pressured by the Taliban, while simultaneously implicating India, potentially escalating tensions and reshaping regional security dynamics in South Asia.",
