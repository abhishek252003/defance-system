# 🚀 Deploy ARGUS Defense Intelligence System to Streamlit Cloud

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account (free)
- Web browser

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" 
3. Repository name: `argus-defense-dashboard`
4. Set to **Public** (required for free tier)
5. Do NOT initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files to Repository

Upload these files to your new repository:

```
📁 argus-defense-dashboard/
├── app.py                    ← Main dashboard application
├── requirements_streamlit.txt ← Dependencies (rename to requirements.txt)
├── README.md                 ← Project documentation
├── config.py                 ← Configuration settings
└── .gitignore                ← Git ignore file
```

**Important**: Rename `requirements_streamlit.txt` to `requirements.txt` when uploading.

### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Click "Enter your repository URL"
5. Paste your repository URL: `https://github.com/yourusername/argus-defense-dashboard`
6. Click "Deploy!"

### Step 4: Configure Deployment Settings

- **Repository**: your repository URL
- **Branch**: main
- **Main file path**: app.py
- **App name**: argus-defense (or your choice)
- **Advanced settings**: Leave as default

Click "Deploy!" to start deployment.

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

- Watch the build logs for progress
- First deployment may take 2-5 minutes
- Subsequent deployments are faster

### Step 6: Access Your Live Dashboard

Once deployment completes:
- Your app URL: `https://argus-defense.streamlit.app`
- Share this URL with anyone
- No login required for viewers

## 🎯 Deployment Tips

### For Best Performance
- Keep repository public for free tier
- App sleeps after 7 days of inactivity
- 1GB RAM limit (sufficient for ARGUS)
- Automatic HTTPS and CDN included

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Streamlit Cloud, go to your app settings
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS with your domain provider
4. Enable automatic SSL certificate

### Updating Your App
1. Make changes to your GitHub repository
2. Push commits to main branch
3. Streamlit Cloud automatically redeploys
4. Or manually trigger redeploy from dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment Fails**
- Check requirements.txt format
- Ensure all dependencies are available
- Verify app.py is in root directory

**App Crashes**
- Check logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Ensure database file permissions
- Verify all imports are in requirements.txt

**Slow Performance**
