  "content": "Bipin Joshi, a Nepali student and the only Hindu hostage held by Hamas, has been declared dead after months in captivity. Abducted from Alumim kibbutz during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, Joshi’s family and Nepalese diplomats worked relentlessly to secure his release. His body was handed over to Israeli authorities along with other slain hostages. Israeli DNA tests will confirm his identity before repatriation. Despite video evidence earlier suggesting he was alive, Joshi’s name was not on the recent list of hostages freed by Hamas. This devastating development follows the broader Gaza ceasefire, which saw the release of over 20 hostages and more than 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. The tragedy highlights the human toll of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and the risks faced by foreign nationals caught in war zones.\n\nIndia allrounder Washington Sundar discussed Kuldeep Yadav’s impressive spell, the value of all-rounders, and India’s strategies in Test cricket. He praised Kuldeep for hitting his areas well and generating extra purchase as a wrist spinner on the Delhi track. Sundar highlighted the importance of patience, planning for different batters, and maintaining fitness for long five-day games. He also reflected on his role as an all-rounder, saying it gives him the chance to make an impact with both bat and ball.",
