The Taliban claimed 58 Pakistani soldiers were killed in retaliation for airspace and territorial violations, while Pakistan reported 23 troop casualties and said it had eliminated over 200 Taliban and affiliated fighters. Pakistan’s army chief Asim Munir visited the Afghan border following the escalation. Meanwhile, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, during his visit to Delhi, denied the presence of TTP on Afghan soil and criticized Pakistan’s actions. He accused Islamabad of displacing its own people before the Taliban’s rise and warned that Kabul had “other options” if peace talks failed. He also questioned why Pakistan, despite its strong army and intelligence, could not secure lasting peace.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly skipped Gaza peace summit in Egypt on Monday, fearing backlash from his right-wing political base. The gathering included Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other regional leaders. Netanyahu has long opposed PA involvement in post-war Gaza, comparing Ramallah’s two-state stance to Hamas’s objectives. His coalition partners also reject any role for Abbas in Gaza’s administration. Reports suggest the decision came last-minute, as Netanyahu sought to avoid angering supporters by sharing a platform with leaders critical of his policies. The move highlights growing political tensions amid Gaza’s post-conflict planning. Watch",
