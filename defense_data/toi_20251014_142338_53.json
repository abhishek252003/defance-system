As Israel releases thousands of Palestinian prisoners in exchange, the fate of Bipin and other unaccounted hostages remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nHamas is preparing to release 48 Israeli hostages ahead of the Monday deadline under the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal. The group has relocated the hostages to several locations and will meet Red Cross officials tonight to finalize release logistics. However, the exchange faces uncertainty as Hamas demands the release of seven high-profile Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. Israel has so far refused, though Hamas is offering an earlier release in return. Talks are ongoing to resolve the timing, prisoner list, and return of bodies as part of the ceasefire implementation.
