  "content": "The IMF has lauded India for its innovative and bold economic reforms, from GST and income tax overhaul to digital payments and Aadhaar integration. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said India “proved doubters wrong” by implementing reforms that many deemed impossible. India is now projected to grow 6.5-6.8% over the next two years, making it a global economic engine in a slow-growth world. Amid US-China trade tensions and rising global debt, India’s policy reforms provide a model of resilience and innovation. Georgieva emphasized the importance of continued vigilance on debt and liquidity challenges affecting 150 developing nations, even as India demonstrates leadership in structural transformation.\n\nA Haryana police officer, ASI Sandeep Lather, allegedly committed suicide in Rohtak, citing corruption and expressing support for former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarnia. Lather, posted with the cyber cell, made a final video calling Bijarnia an honest officer. The incident comes just days after ADGP Y Puran Kumar reportedly died by suicide at his Chandigarh residence, leaving a note naming 16 senior IAS and IPS officers, alleging harassment. Following these events, the Haryana government placed the state’s DGP on leave and replaced Rohtak SP Bijarnia with Surinder Singh Bhoria. Police cordoned off the area, recovered the weapon, and initiated a forensic investigation into Lather’s death.",
