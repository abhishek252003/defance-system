  "content": "The U.S. military is making one of its most significant pushes yet into modern nuclear power with a program to put small reactors on Army bases across much of the country where strained power grids can’t keep up with rising energy demands.\n\nThe Army on Tuesday unveiled the Janus Program, which aims to supply bases by 2028 with microreactors—tiny reactors generating less than 20 megawatts of electricity, generally enough to power a small town. That is a fraction of theenergy output that larger modern reactors can produce, but the microreactors are small enough to move on a containership or aircraft.The reactors will help keep weapons powered and maintain critical base operations when other energy sources go down because of bad weather, cyberattacks or other grid disruptions, the Army said.“What resilience means to us is that we have power, no matter what, 24-7,” said Jeff Waksman, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army.The reactors will be owned and operated by commercial companies, although the Army and Energy Department will help with technical aspects and uranium fuel supply. The Army is in the process of selecting nine bases for the initial phase of the program, and by next year will choose the commercial vendors to build two microreactors apiece for each base, Waksman said.Interest from the Army is a promising opportunity for nuclear-power startups that have raised billions of dollars for projects includingsmall reactors, uranium enrichment and new fuel technologiesbut in many cases are years away from completing a product.“The race today is to actually develop the capability.
