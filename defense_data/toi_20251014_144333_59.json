  "content": "At the UN General Assembly, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey condemned Pakistan for serious violations of the UN’s Children and Armed Conflict (CAC) agenda. He accused Pakistan of cross-border attacks harming children in Afghanistan and India, including shelling Indian villages in May 2025. Dubey called out Pakistan’s hypocrisy for preaching on global platforms while abusing children’s rights at home, as highlighted in the UN Secretary-General’s CAC 2025 report. He also mentioned India's Operation Sindoor, which targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Praising India’s efforts to protect child rights, he highlighted initiatives like the child helpline and anti-trafficking measures, urging Pakistan to address its internal issues first.\n\nHundreds gathered in Portland to protest against ICE, but it was the naked cyclists who grabbed national attention. Braving rain and pepper spray, the riders circled a federal immigration facility, symbolising vulnerability and resistance. Clashes erupted between anti-ICE demonstrators and pro-Trump counter protesters, while federal agents looked on from rooftops. Protesters say the city must act against ICE for violating local agreements, as tensions rise over immigration enforcement. This marks three months of protest in Oregon’s largest city.",
