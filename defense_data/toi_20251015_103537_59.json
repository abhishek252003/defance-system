  "content": "Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Director General of Military Operations, spoke about the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam where 26 tourists were killed by terrorists from across the LoC. The attackers targeted victims based on their community, killing them in front of their families. Initially claimed by the Kashmir Resistance Front, the group later withdrew. Between April 22 and May 6-7, the armed forces carefully planned their response, prioritising targets and deploying precautionary measures on borders. Lt Gen Ghai highlighted strong coordination among military, government departments, and agencies, along with an active information warfare campaign, ensuring a strategic and effective response to the horrific attack.\n\nAhead of releasing 20 Israeli hostages, Hamas orchestrated emotional video calls between captives and their families in Gaza. Footage showed masked Hamas operatives beside the hostages, many wearing fake military uniforms. Families at Israel’s Re’im base reacted with tears and relief as hostages confirmed they were safe. This marked a shift from prior propaganda ceremonies. The releases are part of a Trump-brokered ceasefire, with Hamas set to hand over hostages to the Red Cross, while Israel prepares to release over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.",
