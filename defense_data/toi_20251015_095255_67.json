  "content": "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch publicly criticised British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his handling of the Gaza peace talks. Starmer was seen visibly squirming as Badenoch praised Donald Trump’s administration and slammed the Labour leader for diminishing the UK’s influence in the region. The debate focused on the recent release of 20 surviving Israeli hostages on October 13, with Badenoch arguing that the Prime Minister’s approach failed to place the UK at the centre of diplomatic efforts. Chants of “shame” echoed through Parliament as tensions flared over the UK’s role in the Israel-Hamas peace process. Watch the full exchange here.\n\nDonald Trump stunned the Gaza summit audience by inviting Shehbaz Sharif on stage mid-speech. The Pakistan PM seized the moment to heap glowing praise on Trump, calling him “the man the world needed most” and crediting him with stopping a potential India-Pakistan war. Trump’s quip afterward, “Wow! I didn’t expect that”, summed up the theatrical diplomacy that unfolded. The optics of the moment have sparked intense debate across diplomatic circles.",
