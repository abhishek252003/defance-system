In a post on X, Modi said he spoke with Trump to commend the peace initiative and discuss progress in ongoing trade talks. He also welcomed the joint efforts of Trump and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to end hostilities and secure the release of hostages in Gaza. Modi expressed hope that humanitarian aid and the ceasefire would bring relief to affected civilians. Trump had earlier announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed on the first phase of the US-backed 20-point plan, which includes a ceasefire and prisoner exchange. The breakthrough followed key negotiations held in Cairo with regional stakeholders.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the arrest of a man who sent a threatening letter to podcaster Benny Johnson. The development comes a month after conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot dead at Utah University. Bondi warned that the Donald Trump administration would not allow the political violence to continue any longer.",
