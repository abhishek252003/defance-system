Speaking alongside Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, Trump urged Putin to settle the conflict and warned of Russia’s economic struggles, including long lines for gasoline. Trump also confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Washington on Friday and discussed the potential delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, highlighting the balance between defending Ukraine’s territory and the risk of escalation with Russia.
